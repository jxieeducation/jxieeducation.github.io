* [Video Gaming Made Me a History Major](https://medium.com/bright/video-gaming-made-me-a-history-major-feddbce24c9e) "To us, gaming has made history seem less remote and more, well, epic. It’s a secret we keep mostly to ourselves. It’s easy to memorize dates when you know the stories already."
* [Elon Musk Chose Himself: Here's How](http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=ca6ae38471d227b05e07a47e9&id=994dda80bd) “It’s OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.”

* [What Would Wu-Tang Do?](https://medium.com/@molbarton/what-would-wu-tang-do-d9983c35ad26) "Rather than each of them trying to build their own brand, they pooled their talents and early fan bases and earned visibility and professional leverage as a collective group while maintaining individual freedom to record."
* [The $1,000 CPM](https://medium.com/@hankgreen/the-1-000-cpm-f92717506a4b) "It encourages a different kind of content. Instead of challenging creators to figure out how to get the highest view counts, creators have to puzzle out how to make the most valuable content."

* [Ten Lessons from GitHub’s First Year](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/03/29/ten-lessons-from-githubs-first-year.html) "A lot has been written recently about how the venture capital world is changing. I don’t pretend to be an expert on the subject, but I’ve learned enough to say that a web startup like ours doesn’t need any outside money to succeed. I know this because we haven’t taken a single dime from investors. We bootstrapped the company on a few thousand dollars and became profitable the day we opened to the public and started charging for subscriptions."
* [The Minimum Viable Product: A Primer](https://medium.com/galleys/the-minimum-viable-product-a-primer-3d9a76dd5213) "What separates MVPs from traditional market research is that it is a deliberate experimentation approach based in customer behavior, not opinion.

* [Giving Students Control](https://medium.com/synapse/alted-giving-students-control-cdc5a03b277b) "Grade yourself. In the work world, you will often have to justify your usefulness to a company, save your job from budget cuts, or explain why you deserve a promotion. I am required to enter a grade for you at the end of the semester; you will tell me what grade you deserve and why. (Want an instant “A”? See “Travel,” above.) How would you grade yourself in Life? Hmm."
* [Hacking Company Culture](https://medium.com/@pedramkeyani/hacking-company-culture-1daa3be1d769) "Hackathons help teach your team that failure is a good thing, that it’s the flip side of innovation. After all, you can’t have that one amazing idea without exploring hundreds, or even thousands of “bad” ideas."

"I figured I have four months to fix whatever I did wrong now [before Summer Promotion], and do better next time."
* [What is the best way to start my career: Uber or Zenefits?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-start-my-career-Uber-or-Zenefits) "Problem is, these venture-funded companies end up smoking a lot of their own PR-pipe as they run around convincing people to grant them press exposure and investment money.
This leads to a pretty beefy lack of humility after awhile. Chasing all of this outside validation makes your issue seem like an affront to their story, and therefore to their personal investment in the organization."
* [How can one become part of the 1%?](http://www.quora.com/How-can-one-become-part-of-the-1) "Learn how to scale yourself and the business. This means learning how to delegate, how to motivate others and recruit great talent to do works you don't know how or can't. My company is filled with people I recruited and most of them are unconventional successes as well. My sales guy Joe is a great example of this. Without the efforts of others, there is no way I am where I am today."

* [How to Avoid Making Huge Mistakes with Life’s Big Decisions](https://medium.com/@evolvable/how-to-avoid-making-huge-mistakes-with-life-s-big-decisions-2e9a71af00bc) "We hadn’t considered all our options. Once we started to look away from the beach, we saw one apartment, we liked the look of it, and we got railroaded into buying it by a really good salesman."
* [My son has $23.6 billion. How is yours doing?](https://medium.com/@Ken_Rosen/my-son-has-23-6-billion-how-is-yours-doing-a03893b672ac) "Start a simulation mindset for major strategic decisions. Determine the minimum viable model you can use to represent your situation. Use that model to create a game, discussion, or workshop. Play."
