  <li><a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/story/medium/">The making of Medium</a> “Medium is a system for reading and writing. A place where you can find and share knowledge, ideas, and stories—specifically, ones that need more than 140 characters and are not just for your friends. It’s a place where you can work with others to create something better than you can on your own.”</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/1">MS build pull request 1 [github]</a> “MSBuild has caused me years of pain, replacing it with Make is probably sensible.”</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2015/01/20.html">Stack Exchange Raises $40m</a> “Everything about how Stack Overflow works today was designed to make programmers’ jobs easier. We let members vote up answers, so we can show you the best answer first. We don’t allow opinionated questions, because they descend into flame wars that don’t help people who need an answer right now. We have scrupulously avoided any commercialization of our editorial content, because we want to have a site that programmers can trust.”</li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@EngineerRemorse/my-0-5-million-mistake-three-lessons-c58f37cd4c2a">My $0.5M mistake</a> “Lesson Two: Don’t be immature. Think win/win.”</li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@dancrisan/sometimes-you-win-sometimes-you-learn-4a996dec116a">Sometimes You Win, Sometimes You Learn</a> “But there is one common thing that we might not see and that is certainly there: we don’t see the efforts, we don’t see the all-nighters, the time spent practicing, we don’t see the streams of frustrations and misunderstandings and internal struggles on motivation and discipline and all the ins and outs that trying to be focused implies. We don’t see that being there is, basically, just being you. We don’t see that being at that top level, is being through all the possible low levels.”</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ronco.html">The Ronco Principle</a> “When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought “How lucky that someone so powerful is so benevolent.” But gradually I realized it wasn’t luck. It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful. “</li>

  <li><a href="https://medium.com/galleys/can-a-book-be-a-startup-a617fc0786c0">Can a book be a startp?</a> “It doesn’t ask customers what they want. It is an experiment designed to measure behavior, not opinion.”</li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@gkoberger/five-years-time-6a6ae1157a66">Five years time</a> “This time, it was much easier. The interview was still tough, however it was different: we had proof users loved us, rather than just saying we hoped they would. I can’t stress this enough. You can get in to YC with just an idea, however it’s so much easier if you have users.”</li>

I am going to contribute.” As someone who leads/listens to a team, I often use the way in which somebody says “Good morning” as a barometer of their mood. It tells me how they are feeling without me having to ask.’</li>
