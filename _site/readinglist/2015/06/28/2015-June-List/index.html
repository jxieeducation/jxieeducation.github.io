Every office-bound exec wants to love a startup. Like a pet. But no one wants to buy from a startup. Especially big companies. Big companies want to buy from big, stable businesses. They want to trust that you’ll still be around in a few years.”</li>

The vector canvas should be adaptive, meaning the size isn’t fixed, so we can design in and for all the screen sizes and orientations our app will eventually live in.”</li>

They must have some goal in mind that’s really important for them, which is replenishing their willpower every time it gets spent. Willpower is finite and it should be used for the most important+unpleasant tasks.”</li>

But if that’s not what you want, leave quickly. One or two years post-college at a company like Google is great. 10 years? Not so much. You will continue to learn, but there are diminishing returns of sticking around.”</li>

The Benefits of Latent Learning</a> “Singing had forced me to be aware of other parts of the song, instead of just reacting to the notes in front of me. If you’re stuck on a plateau, you might also be battling some challenge that you’re not even consciously aware of. In my case, I realized that one learning to be aware of the vocal cues while playing the guitar meant I had to focus on a bunch of new information.”</li>

Ideally, don’t raise 12 months of capital out of the gate, expecting to go back out raising in eight months when down to four months of cash. Instead, raise 18 months of capital and start raising again when down to nine months of capital in the bank.”</li>

A friend once told me that the best hire he made was a mistake. Had he properly screened this candidate’s technical ability, he wouldn’t have hired the candidate. But it turned out this engineer was so driven that he immediately made everyone else on the team more driven. Just by hiring him, the team became more productive, which far outweighed that individual being an average engineer. It’s sometimes worth trading off some technical ability to get a multiplier for your whole team.”</li>
